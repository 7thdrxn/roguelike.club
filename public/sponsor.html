            <p>This Roguelike Celebration is a volunteer project that we're doing out of affection for roguelike games, with generously donated venue space. Can you or your companys help make this celebration happen? Here are a few wonderful things we'd like to be able to include, which require more money than we can pay out of pocket.</p>

            <p>We're expecting the audience to include lots of people who are developers or interested in game development, along with many people who are interested in gaming, computer culture, and game history in general. We're targeting getting at least 100 attendees; our venue can hold up to 200.</p>

            <p>If you're interested in any of this, please let us know by emailing contact@roguelike.club!</p>

            <h2>Sponsor one, two, or three speakers - $500, $1000, or $1500</h2>

            <p>There are several amazing people important to the history of roguelikes who are interested in speaking at this event, but they live in faraway places and they wouldn't be able to attend without assistance with travel costs. We'd like to give enough money to each faraway speaker to subsidize their plane and hotel costs, according to what their costs and needs are, so that they can attend!</p>

            <p><i>We would thank you on stage, put up a sign at the event, and put your company logo on our website.</i></p>

            <h2>Sponsor decorations - $200</h2>

            <p>We'd love to be able to decorate the Eventbrite office to look like a proper dungeon-crawling event should look &mdash; candlelabras, tins of spinach, statues of centaurs... We could do a lot of amazing decorating with some clever shopping and about $200.</p>

            <p><i>We would put up a sign at the event explaining that you sponsored the decorations! Yay!</i></p>

            <h2>Sponsor swag - $200</h2>

            <p>We want to make t-shirts, buttons, and other fun things for attendees and speakers who want them. It'd be great to be able to give this to people as part of attending instead of charging them separately for it.</p>

            <p><i>We would put up a sign on the swag table explaining that you sponsored the swag!</i></p>
