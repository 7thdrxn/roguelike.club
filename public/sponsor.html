            <p>This Roguelike Celebration is a meeting of professional
            software developers, industry members in roles such as QA
            and tech writers, game enthusiasts, and more. We are
            meeting to celebrate our affection for roguelike games,
            with venue space generously donated by Eventbrite, and our
            event staff is 100% volunteer.</p>

            <p><strong>About our costs:</strong> There are several
            amazing people important to the history of roguelikes who
            are interested in speaking at this event, but they live in
            faraway places and they wouldn't be able to attend without
            assistance with travel costs. To provide compelling
            content, we need to bring these faraway speakers to San
            Francisco! Name tags, festive roguelike decorations, and
            after-party space add to our expenses.</p>

            <p>We're expecting over 100 attendees interested in
            gaming, computer culture, and video game history. Can you
            or your company help make this celebration happen? If so,
            we want to help you reach our attendees.</p>

            <p>If you're interested in any of this, please let us know
            by
            emailing <a href="mailto:contact@roguelike.club">contact@roguelike.club</a>!
