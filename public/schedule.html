            <h3><a href="http://nickm.com/">Nick Montfort</a></h3>
            <p>Nick Montfort works in creative computing, particularly as it relates to language and text. He develops computational art and poetry, often collaboratively. He studies video and computer games, popular and obfuscated programming, digital poetry and other electronic literature, demoscene productions, and aspects of computing that are less easily classified. He is professor of digital media at MIT and lives in New York and Boston.</p>
            <p>Levels of Rogue are virtual spaces, but also typographical grids that relate to a 1st century Latin word square, typewriters from the 19th century, concrete poetry and visual art in the 20th century, and preceding computer games. By considering the history of monospace type, character sets, and the visual arrangement of punctuation and letters, along with the ways language has been inscribed by hand, by machine, and digitally, it's possible to see new genealogies for roguelikes and new contributions these games have made.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Biskup">Thomas Biskup</a></h3>
            <p>24 years of <a href="http://www.adom.de/home/index.html">ADOM</a> in 24 minutes - Anecdotes, experiences, game design opinions and various other stories from my life as the ADOM creator and maintainer.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://twitter.com/madjackmcmad">Jim Shepard</a></h3>
            <p>Surface-dusting Storytelling: Humor and Fiction in Dungeonmans. Roguelike players enjoy building their own fiction around the adventures of their hero, and this is usually encouraged by the ridiculous specifics and wild build customization available in most RLs. There's a spectrum between a blank canvas world where everything centers on the travels of your murderhobo, and a highly detailed world with concrete fiction such as Qud. Jim will talk about how you can bring more of their setting's ideas to life without having to dive too deeply into a fiction, as well as how to apply humor with enough subtlety as to not beat players over the head with it.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://www.neurohack.com/">George Moromisato</a></h3>
            <p>George Moromisato writes a love letter to Nethack, and talks about how adapting its mechanics to his game, <a href="https://transcendence.kronosaur.com/">Transcendence</a>, taught him more about game design than any course or book.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://alt.org/">Drew Streib</a></h3>
            <p>Drew is the owner of <a href="https://alt.org/nethack/">nethack.alt.org</a> and the host of nethackwiki.com, and the author go dgamelaunch (the frontend for most public nethack and nethack variant servers these days). He will talk about the role of public servers for roguelikes and will field questions about NAO.</p>
            <h3>Alexei Pepers</h3>
            <p>Alexei will talk about the research that she did with John Aycock on making roguelike games accessible for visually impaired players. She will go over: some of the issues in accessibility for visually impaired players and how they related to roguelikes, why roguelikes are particularly good candidates for accessibility and what existing roguelikes are accessible, the work that they did on making Nethack accessible by changing aspects of the interface while keeping the underlying gameplay the game, the issues they ran into when making these changes such as the complexity of corridors, the results they had when getting visually impaired players to try out our altered version of Nethack, and finally some conclusions about how roguelikes might be made much more accessible with reasonably few changes.</p>
            <h3><a href="https://twitter.com/badnewsgame">Bad News</a></h3>
            <p>James Ryan and Ben Samuels will present <a href="https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/ryanEtAl_BadNewsCHI2016.pdf">Bad News</a>, a procedurally generated theater experience. They will do multiple performances throughout the day - and we will take sing-ups for timeslots as the event approaches!</p>
