                  To the uninitiated, roguelikes appear simple: text blips denoting monsters and legendary heroes prowl through dungeons hewn from hash signs and periods. Under the hood, these games abound with clever algorithms that ensure no two adventures will ever be the same. Dungeon Hacks author David L. Craddock plumbs depths of 10,000 feet to discuss the history of the genre—from primordial titles like Beneath Apple Manor and Rogue to contemporary classics such as NetHack and Angband, and the foundational tropes that inspire the roguelike authors of today.

                  This talk examines how features of the roguelike
                  genre relate to accessibility for visually impaired players, using
                  Nethack as a case study. Several changes were made to Nethack to
                  make it more accessible, and the feedback from this case study
                  provides several lessons as to how roguelike games in general can be
                  made more accessible, as well as what aspects of them pose the
                  biggest challenges to accessibility.

                  Surface-dusting Storytelling: Humor and Fiction in
                  Dungeonmans. Roguelike players enjoy building their
                  own fiction around the adventures of their hero, and
                  this is usually encouraged by the ridiculous
                  specifics and wild build customization available in
                  most RLs. There's a spectrum between a blank canvas
                  world where everything centers on the travels of
                  your murderhobo, and a highly detailed world with
                  concrete fiction such as Qud. Jim will talk about
                  how you can bring more of their setting's ideas to
                  life without having to dive too deeply into a
                  fiction, as well as how to apply humor with enough
                  subtlety as to not beat players over the head with
                  it.

                  community before setting out to create a grand and
                  innovative roguelike with just the right mix of
                  traditional and modern features to help guide the
                  genre towards a more mainstream audience without
                  losing anything that makes roguelikes great.

                  Procedurally generated content is
                  great, but writing so much custom code becomes
                  unwieldy and too many great projects die tangled-up
                  in long chains of if-statements.  Tracery, a popular
                  and newbie-friendly generation tool, can keep data
                  for procedural content generation separate from the
                  gameplay code, while still generating neat stuff.
                  The creator of Tracery demos a few neat tricks
                  (no-hassle reskinning of RPGs and more!) and shows
                  some hard-earned lessons for how keeping your data
