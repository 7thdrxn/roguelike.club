            <h1 id="thing" class="cover-heading">Let's get together and celebrate Roguelikes!</h1>
            <p class="lead">Roguelike games have been part of gaming culture for over 30 years! For most of us they have a deep and special place in our hearts. There are so many fans across age groups and around the world that there should be a place for all of them to get together and celebrate these unique games.</p>
            <p class="lead">July 31st in San Francisco: talks, playing together, strategy advice, helping each other try new games, speedruns to watch, and your favorite slime molds to eat.</p>

            <p class="lead">We're still figuring out how much this is cost, but we plan to make it cheap enough that whether you've played since 1987 or are curious but have never tried them (or got killed by an grid bug) you'll be able to afford attending. We were inspired to do this by the <a href="http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=IRDC">International Roguelike Development Conference</a> - but the theme of this will be a lot different. It's for all of us - the players!</p>
            
            <p class="lead">Who are we? We're just some friends working on this idea.</p>
            
            <h1 id="email-list" class="cover-heading">Want to attend or just get updates?</h1>

            <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NOpFWPpI9P562t7EeWxEYN78mIBP_O3sB7ts7xDM3oc/viewform?usp=send_form"><strong>Fill out this tiny survey and put in your email address.</strong></a> We will send you occasional news (not too much).</p>

			<h1 id="cfp" class="cover-heading">Call for presenters</h1>
			
            <p>Interested in giving a talk (whether 2 minutes or 20 minutes), teaching a workshop, mentoring new players, or sharing something else? No speaking experience required; we would love to hear from you. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13U_Ov94CVX8g10_5qYjwSvTP7AkLUIVduRPyO7Z9mdc/viewform"><strong>Send your idea to us.</strong></a></p>

            <h1 id="schedule" class="cover-heading">Schedule ideas</h1>
            <p>Here's what we're thinking this could look like.</p>

            <p>Friday evening — informal hanging out and time to chat.</p>
            <p>Saturday (whole day would also have the alternate option to just sit around and play and talk):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Start with potions of coffee and an introduction.</li>
              <li>Two talks (about 20 minutes each) about interesting topics, such as the early history of roguelike development or a comparison of weird/cool things about popular roguelikes. Plus: alternate room with strategy workshops, such as ways to steal items from shops or ways to defeat the nastiest monsters.</li>
              <li>Break! There will totally be amusing decorations like figurines of random animals.</li>
              <li>Two more short talks (such as the role of literature in NetHack, or showing a screen of code and explaining it line by line to introduce non-developers to development) + alternate room with more strategy workshops.</li>
              <li>Comestibles. There could be many options for lunch: tins of spinach, pudding, eucalyptus leaves, fortune cookies, royal jelly...</li>
              <li>Lightning talks (2 minutes each, open to anyone). Plus: alternate room with speedrunners starting a couple games.</li>
              <li>Break! At least for the people not absorbed in playing.</li>
              <li>A couple more talks (while the speedrunners continue). More potential topics for talks: explaining good plot/level design or talking about a new in-development roguelike.</li>
              <li>Break.</li>
              <li>Last talk with some sort of thoughtful and delightful and inspiring subject.</li>
              <li>General play time! Perhaps try a game you haven't tried before, with the option of help from experienced players when you get stuck (or offer to help others). Plus: wiki editing time, collaboratively updating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Roguelike_video_games">articles on Wikipedia</a> and other popular wikis, such as <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page">NetHackWiki</a>, <a href="http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Crawl_Wiki">Crawl Wiki</a>, and <a href="http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Main_Page">RogueBasin</a>.</li>
              <li>Possibly a venue change — option to go somewhere and eat/drink/hang out.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Possibly: contests and prizes of some kind (3-D printed cheap plastic imitations of the Amulet of Yendor?), extra appreciation if you cosplay as a monster or a character class, art display/sales, entertaining decorations with candelabras and crystal balls...</p>

            <h1 id="policies" class="cover-heading">Making things fun</h1>

            <p>All levels of experience welcome</p>
            <p>All ages; people with kids welcome</p>
            <p>Friendly and respectful (will have a code of conduct; <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules">Recurse Center style rules</a> especially for people helping each other learn new things)</p>
            <p>Aiming for balanced gender ratio among participants/speakers/etc.</p>
            <p>Finding an accessible venue; accommodating people with disabilities</p>

            <h1 id="seealso" class="cover-heading">Other things you might like</h1>

            <h1 id="who" class="cover-heading">We like roguelikes</h1>
            <h3><a href="https://twitter.com/SwartzCr">Noah</a> is the person plotting this</h2>
            <p>I'm a long time roguelike fan. I attended IRDC US this last year, and I'll be working on this along with some close friends in San Francisco. We want the event to be accessible, so we hope to make the event cheap or free - this is a labor of love. We've all have experience organizing things in the past and we're going to be working hard to make sure this event happens and is worth attending!</p>
            <h3><a href="http://jeweledplatypus.org/">Britta</a> is a co-conspirator</h2>
            <p>I've been playing Nethack since I was a kid, when I found it on a Mac OS 8 shareware games site. I like helping make things happen; I ran <a href="http://www.jailbreakcon.com/">conferences</a> as part of my old job, and I help run a <a href="http://www.doubleunion.org/">nonprofit hackerspace</a> for fun.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://asheesh.org/">Asheesh</a> is also a co-conspirator</h2>
            <p>In 2001, I was fascinated and confused to find Falcon's Eye, a GUI variant of NetHack, pre-installed on my Mandrake Linux system. I concluded that PINE was a more enjoyable video game, and I enjoy writing email to this very day. I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://sandstorm.io/">Sandstorm.io</a>, a founder of <a href="https://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a>, a developer in Debian, a retired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Linux">Xbox-Linux</a> wiki admin, and a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/madprime/6162437989">juggler</a>.</p>
