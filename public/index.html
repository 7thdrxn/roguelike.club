            <p>Roguelike games have been part of gaming culture for over 30 years! They have a deep and special place in our hearts. There are so many fans across age groups and around the world that there should be a place for all of them to get together and celebrate these unique games.</p>
            <p>We were inspired to do this by the <a href="http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=IRDC">International Roguelike Development Conference</a> — and instead of a focus on development, this will be for all of us — the players!</p>

            <h1>When and where?</h1>

            <p><strong>Saturday, September 17th, 2016 in San Francisco</strong>: a day of talks, playing together, strategy advice, helping each other try new games, speedruns to watch, and your favorite slime molds to eat.</p>

            <h1 id="email-list" class="cover-heading">Want to attend or just get updates?</h1>

            <p class="lead"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NOpFWPpI9P562t7EeWxEYN78mIBP_O3sB7ts7xDM3oc/viewform?usp=send_form"><strong>Sign up to get updates and news! →</strong></a></p>
            <p>We will send you occasional news, such as when we announce that tickets are available.</p>

            <p>We're still figuring out how much this is cost, but we plan to make it cheap enough that whether you've played since 1987 or are curious but have never tried them (or got killed by an grid bug) you'll be able to afford attending.</p>

			<h1 id="cfp" class="cover-heading">Call for presenters</h1>

            <p>Interested in giving a talk (whether 2 minutes or 20 minutes), teaching a workshop, mentoring new players, or sharing something else? No speaking experience required; we would love to hear from you.</p>

            <p class="lead"><a href="/cfp.html"><strong>Learn more and send your idea or talk proposal to us. →</strong></a></p>

            <p>Please send us your proposal by May 31, 2016!</p>

            <h1 id="policies" class="cover-heading">Our guidelines</h1>
            <p>We're aiming for a friendly and respectful celebration that welcomes players of all levels of experience (including no experience) and of all ages (people with kids welcome).</p>

            <p>Especially for workshops and generally helping each other learn new things, we'll recommend <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules">Recurse Center style social rules</a>.</p>

            <p>We'll also have a code of conduct for all participants, since we're dedicated to a harassment-free conference experience for everyone. <a href="code.html">Our code of conduct.</a></p>
