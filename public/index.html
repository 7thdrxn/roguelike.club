            <p class="lead">Let's make this happen on a Saturday in July or August 2016 in San Francisco: talks, playing together, strategy advice, helping each other try new games, speedruns to watch, and your favorite slime molds to eat.</p>

            <p class="lead">For everyone, free or cheap to attend, whether you've played since 1987 or are curious but have never tried them (or got killed by an ant).</p>

            <p>We're some friends working on this idea. Want to attend, give a talk, mentor fellow players, offer a free venue to use, or participate in some other way? <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1S3UUzyV8CXf_9v_ggKf1vIr-c_7V_myAMVAJmSoTKgM/viewform">Fill out this survey and put in your email address!</a></p>

            <h1 id="schedule" class="cover-heading">Tentative schedule</h1>
            <p>This is what we're thinking this should look like.</p>

            <h1 id="who" class="cover-heading">We like roguelikes</h1>
            <h3><a href="https://twitter.com/SwartzCr">Noah</a> is the person plotting this</h2>
            <p>I'm a long time roguelike fan. I attended IRDC US this last year, and I'll be working on this along with some close friends in San Francisco. We want the event to be accessible, so we hope to make the event cheap or free - this is a labor of love. We've all have experience organizing things in the past and we're going to be working hard to make sure this event happens and is worth attending!</p>
            <h3><a href="http://jeweledplatypus.org/">Britta</a> is a co-conspirator</h2>
            <p>I've been playing Nethack since I was a kid, when I found it on a Mac OS 8 shareware games site. I like helping make things happen; I ran <a href="http://www.jailbreakcon.com/">conferences</a> as part of my old job, and I help run a <a href="http://www.doubleunion.org/">nonprofit hackerspace</a> for fun.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://asheesh.org/">Asheesh</a> is also a co-conspirator</h2>
            <p>In 2001, I was fascinated and confused to find Falcon's Eye, a GUI variant of NetHack, pre-installed on my Mandrake Linux system. I concluded that PINE was a more enjoyable video game, and I enjoy writing email to this very day. I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://sandstorm.io/">Sandstorm.io</a>, a founder of <a href="https://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a>, a developer in Debian, a retired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Linux">Xbox-Linux</a> wiki admin, and a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/madprime/6162437989">juggler</a>.</p>
