            <h1 id="seealso" class="cover-heading">Code of Conduct</h1>

            <p>Our goal is to have a fun and welcoming celebration of roguelike games for everyone, so we have a formalized Code of Conduct that sets these expectations.</p>

            <p>Everyone includes: people of any age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, race, religion, or level of experience.</p>

            <p>We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>

           <h2>How to report</h2>

            <ul>
            <li>Email <strong>contact at roguelike.club</strong> to report a Code of Conduct violation or any concerns or questions.</li>
            <li>Or if you're in our social/chat space, you can use the <strong>/mod</strong> command to send us a message.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This reaches the organizing team listed on the <a href="./who.html">About us page</a>, as well as a few collaborators and former organizers. If you have a report or concern related to an organizer, please contact a different member of the organizing team directly (see that page for direct email addresses).</p>

            <p>If you're not sure whether something is a Code of Conduct problem, please reach out &mdash; we want to hear your concerns and do our best to reduce harm to this community.</p>

            <p>We will acknowledge your message ASAP, work quickly to determine an appropriate response, and let you know our response. For example, if an event participant harasses or disrupts people, we may revoke their event ticket and ban them from future events.</p>

           <h2>Scope</h2>

            <p>This applies to all Roguelike Celebration virtual and physical spaces, including chat and talk content.</p>

            <p>If you're proactively concerned about a person participating in Roguelike Celebration (such as a speaker, organizer, or attendee) based on previous harm they have done, we want to hear that report as well.</p>

             <h2>Definitions</h2>

             <p>Unacceptable behavior includes:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances</li>
              <li>Racist, sexist, or transphobic jokes</li>
              <li>Deliberate or persistent misgendering</li>
              <li>Offensive comments related to age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, race, or religion</li>
              <li>Support for fascist, neo-nazi, white supremacist, white nationalist, or conspiracy theory groups/movements</li>
              <li>Personal insults or attacks</li>
              <li>Harassment of any kind, even in a joking or ironic manner</li>
              <li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
              <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
              <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We prioritize the safety and wellness of marginalized people over the comfort of privileged people. We do not consider complaints of "reverse racism" or "reverse sexism" to be valid.</p>
