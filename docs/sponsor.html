          <p><strong>Thank you for your interest in sponsoring Roguelike Celebration!</strong></p>

          <img src="photos/sponsorship.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 2em; margin-top: 2em;"
            alt="Roguelike Celebration 2018 audience" />

          <p><strong>Roguelike Celebration</strong> is an annual event celebrating roguelike games and games/art that
            use procedural generation. It features a single-track conference of technical and game design talks, and has
            activities ranging from an arcade where game developers can show off their in-progress work to artistic
            performances and installations such as a bot-generated comedy show and an immersive theatre piece involving
            live improv actors.
          </p>

          <p>We have ~200 in-person attendees (many of whom self-identify as game developers or run their own indie game
            studios), plus typically 100+ viewers on our Twitch livestream. Videos of the event
            are published to our YouTube channel with over 2,500 subscribers, and our most popular videos have been
            watched nearly 60,000 times. </p>

          <h2>Contact</h2>
          <p>Send us an email at <a
              href="mailto:contact@roguelike.club?subject=I want to sponsor Roguelike Celebration!">contact@roguelike.club</a>
            to get the conversation started!</p>

          <h2>Sponsorship Levels</h2>

          <h3>Tin ($500)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Logo on the website and welcome slide</li>
            <li>A short video or game trailer played at the conference during breaks</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Silver ($2,000)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Everything included in Tin sponsorship</li>
            <li>Swag distribution to all attendees</li>
            <li>Roll-up poster or other signage</li>
            <li>Verbal thanks during conference</li>
            <li>Logo on all email communications</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Gold ($5,000)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Everything included in Silver sponsorship</li>
            <li>2 tickets for employees</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Platinum ($8,000)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Everything included in Gold sponsorship</li>
            <li>5 tickets for employees</li>
            <li>A staffable booth with space for swag, company information, etc</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Additional Sponsorship Opportunities</h2>

          <p>All prices in USD and subject to availability.</p>

          <p>Note:​ the total value of sponsorship will be used to determine your level of sponsorship (e.g. If you
            sponsor live captioning ​in addition to​ a $5,000 USD financial sponsorship, you will become a Platinum
            Sponsor and receive all benefits listed therein)</p>

          <h3>Live Captioning: $3,500</h3>
          <p>This would allow us to provide live text captioning services for in-person attendees and the Twitch
            stream.
            This makes the conference more accessible for everyone! We’ll be working with White Coat Captioning, a
            CART
            services company that focuses on tech conferences.</p>

          <h3>Diversity Speaker Travel Support</h3>
          <p>All money donated here would go to providing speaker travel for speakers identifying with groups (gender,
            race, etc) traditionally underrepresented in the game and technology industries. Roguelike Celebration
            traditionally does not have the budget to pay for speaker travel except in exceptional circumstances, so
            this would directly give us access to a more diverse pool of potential speakers.</p>


          <h3>Diversity Sponsorships</h3>
          <p>This will allow us to make more subsidized/free tickets available to attendees who belong to marginalized
            groups who otherwise wouldn’t be able to attend, and potentially even provide travel and housing stipends.
            This will help ensure our event is as inclusive as possible!</p>

          <h3>Saturday Arcade Party: $2,500</h3>
          <p>Provide themed cocktails (and non-alcoholic mocktails) made by the venue’s bartenders for our combined
            arcade/party after Saturday’s talks. Your logo will be on the custom cocktail menus, plus you’ll get
            special
            recognition before the party starts.</p>

          <h3>Meals</h3>
          <p>Historically, we’ve provided breakfast, lunch, and dinner both days of the conference. Costs are
            variable,
            and your sponsorship would include special recognition before/after each meal. Everyone likes food :)</p>
